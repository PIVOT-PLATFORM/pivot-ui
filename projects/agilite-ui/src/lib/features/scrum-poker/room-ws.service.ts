/**
 * Minimal STOMP client wrapper for a single planning poker room (US09.1.2).
 *
 * Wraps `@stomp/rx-stomp`'s `RxStomp` to connect to the **native** (non-SockJS) `/ws/agilite`
 * endpoint — the backend's `WebSocketConfig` registers it without `.withSockJS()` — and
 * subscribe to the room's `wsTopic`. The room-scoped `accessToken` from the join response is
 * presented on the STOMP **native header** `access-token`, attached to the SUBSCRIBE frame
 * (not CONNECT): the token proves membership in *this* room, not the caller's whole session,
 * so it only needs to accompany the subscription to that room's topic.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow in scope — one room per service instance, no generic multi-domain WS
 * abstraction, no message parsing/typing beyond raw bodies. Connection state is exposed as a
 * `signal` (this repo's established local-state primitive, see `CLAUDE.md`) rather than an
 * `Observable`, mirroring the equivalent continuous-state fields already used by other module's
 * own STOMP wrapper (e.g. `WhiteboardSyncService.status` in pivot-collaboratif-ui); discrete
 * incoming frames are exposed as an `Observable` ({@link messages$}), same as that precedent's
 * `remoteActions$`.
 *
 * <p>Since US09.2.1, also supports **publishing** (vote submission) via {@link submitVote} —
 * mirrors `pivot-agilite-core`'s retro STOMP wrapper (`RetroSessionWsService.submitCard`), which
 * added the same capability on top of an initially watch-only service.
