 * client-to-server application destination (the draw itself is a REST call, `POST
 * /wheels/{wheelId}/spin`), so unlike those two this service exposes no `publish`/`submit*`
 * method at all.
 *
 * Presents the caller's real bearer token (not a session-scoped grant) on the `Authorization`
 * native header of the SUBSCRIBE frame, mirroring the `Authorization` HTTP header REST calls use
 * (see backend `WheelChannelInterceptor`). **EN17.3 gap** — exactly like `WheelApiService`'s own
 * documented limitation, this repo has no real token source yet (`@pivot/ui-core` not
 * consumable): callers of {@link connect} pass whatever token is available today, which is
 * `null` in practice until EN17.3 lands. This is not a new gap introduced here — the WebSocket
 * subscription will simply fail its authorization exactly like every REST call already does
 * without a bearer token.
 *
 * Automatic reconnection (and re-subscription to the wheel's topic) is `@stomp/rx-stomp`'s own
 * built-in behavior for an active `watch()` observable — no additional mechanism is written here,
 * same as `RoomWsService`/`RetroSessionWsService` never needed to.
