 * dispatch by the `type` discriminator is the subscriber's job (`SessionRoomComponent`), mirroring
 * `RoomWsService.messages$`'s same design choice.
 *
 * <p>Since US20.1.2b, also supports dot-voting: {@link castVote}/{@link uncastVote} publish to
 * the grant's `voteDestination`/`voteUncastDestination`, and every participant (not just the
 * facilitator) is additionally subscribed to their own private `/user/queue/votes` for
