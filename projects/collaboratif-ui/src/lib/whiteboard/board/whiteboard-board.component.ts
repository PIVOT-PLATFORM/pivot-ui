/**
 * Route-level container for a single board (`/whiteboard/{boardId}`, US08.3.2b).
 *
 * Owns the {@link WhiteboardSyncService} lifecycle (connect on init, disconnect on
 * destroy) and renders the connection-state banners/toast (AC7-11) around the local
 * `WhiteboardCanvasComponent` (US08.3.2a), which stays STOMP-unaware by design. Bridges
 * the two: canvas `drawAction` outputs are published over STOMP, validated remote
 * actions are applied back onto the canvas via {@link WhiteboardCanvasComponent.applyRemoteAction},
 * and canvas `undoAction` outputs are relayed as `UNDO { eventId }` (US08.3.3 AC5).
 *
 * Board membership is already verified by `boardAccessGuard` before this component is
 * ever activated (route `canActivate`); this component does not repeat that HTTP call —
 * only reconnect-time re-verification happens, and it is entirely server-side (STOMP
 * SUBSCRIBE authorisation, US08.3.1), surfaced here only through {@link WhiteboardSyncService}
 * revocation handling.
 *
 * Also renders `PresencePanelComponent` (US08.5.1) — the participants list/avatar panel — as
 * a plain sibling overlay above the canvas, top-right (see template + its own stylesheet).
 * Unlike `WhiteboardPresenceComponent` (US08.3.2c, cursor overlay), it is **not** projected
 * through the canvas's `wb-canvas-area` `<ng-content>` slot: that slot is documented as
 * decorative/`pointer-events: none` only, while the presence panel needs real interactive
 * affordances (hover tooltip on the "+N" overflow badge) — see that component's own TSDoc for
 * the full split between the two.
